<h1 align="center">Lung Computed Tomography Image Segmentation Using U-Net Convolutional Neural Network</h1>

This repository was made to organize the files used to the research "Lung Computed Tomography Image Segmentation Using U-Net Convolutional Neural Network",
developed by Yana Santos under guidance of Professor Doctor Anderson Meneses and Professor Davi Guimar√£es,during 2021 and 2022, on Computational Intelligence
Laboratory of UFOPA (LabIC-Ufopa).

The objective of the present work is the segmentation of lung computed tomography using the FCN, delimit the lungs in the tomography, the region of interest that 
is focus of analysis for many purposes, for example, the detection of pulmonary nodules for early diagnosis of lung cancer.

The dataset used is composed of 267 lungs CT scans and each volume presents a 2D image and a corresponding mask representing the ROI highlighted in white
and the background in black.
